Stacy is my ongoing attempt at creating a digital audio workstation
of a different kind.

It is an interactive Linux application that is controlled exclusively
through a rather minimal user interface: a square grid of back-lit
rubber buttons. There's no screen, no keyboard and no mouse involved.

This application allows its user to manipulate various signals
(audio and other) in real-time through the interactive specification
of a program (or circuit) in a visual programming language.
